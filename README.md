# (Almost) all expl3 functions

This repo contains the source code of a LaTeX document *(Almost) all expl3
functions* that uses the [expltools][2] bundle to generate a list of (almost)
all expl3 functions defined in current TeX Live.

You can typeset the document by running the following command:

```
latexmk functions.tex
```

After running the command, a file [`functions.pdf`][1] with the list of
functions will be created.
